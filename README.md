# RGB-Color-Game

A simple colour guessing game. Given a RGB colour code choose the right colour from the samples presented. 

## Game difficulty

Playing the RGB-Color-Game you can set difficulty: EASY, NORMAL or HARD with 3, 6 or 9 colour samples respectively. NORMAL is set by default, but you can change game difficulty whenever you please.

## Gameplay

Successfully choosing the right colour sample converts all the samples and the header into that colour, otherwise the wrong colour sample fades away.
